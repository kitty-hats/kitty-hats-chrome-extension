                KittyHats is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own and transfer hats, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts, the Chrome Extension and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their hats and use the Smart Contracts to acquire and trade hats with other App users.
                
                Salina Labs, Inc. ("Salina Labs", "we", or "us") is making the App available to you. Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use (these “Terms"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE CHROME EXTENSION, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE CHROME EXTENSION, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE CHROME EXTENSION, OR THE SITE, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE CHROME EXTENSION, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
                
                1. Our KittyHats
                
                A. We have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our initial generation of KittyHats. We will release a certain number of hats “into the wild” (and make them available for purchase) on the day we first launch the App. We will release an additional hats at our sole discretion, and we will make each newly-released hat available for purchase at our sole discretion.
                
                2. The App
                
                A. To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase Ether (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party sites), store Ether, and engage in transactions using Ether. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The App will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other permitted way to interact directly with the App.
                
                B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
                
                C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with any such third parties.
                
                D. It is possible for you to interact with the Smart Contracts we have created directly via the Ethereum network, without using the App as a portal. The process for doing so can be quite complex, however. It is also a violation of these Terms and can result in suspension from the App.
                
                E. You are responsible for the security of your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets) and for any use of your account, whether you knew about it or not. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify us immediately at dan@salinalabs.com.
                
                3. Fees and Payment
                
                A. If you elect to purchase, trade, or donate KittyHats on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted through the Ethereum network via via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or independently using the Smart Contracts.  We are not liable for any lost hats.
                
                B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that, even if you elect to interact directly via the Ethereum network without using the App as a portal, you will still need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Ethereum network.
                
                C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect payment on behalf of KittyHats, Salina Labs, and any other artists or organizations owning rights to any intellectual property involved in the transactions, and permit KittyHats and Salina Labs to disperse the funds at their discretion. You acknowledge and agree that the Paymentn will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network. We will collect a Commission for interactions that involve our Smart Contracts even if they do not involve our App marketplace.
                
                D. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or donation of any of your KittyHats). Except for income taxes levied on Salina Labs, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.
                
                4. Ownership; Restrictions
                
                A. You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to all elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein. The visual interfaces, graphics (including, without limitation, all art and drawings associated with the KittyHats), design, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the “Salina Materials”) are owned by Salina Labs, and are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws. All Salina Materials are the copyrighted property of Salina Labs or its licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names contained in the Salina Materials are proprietary to Salina Labs or its licensors. Except as expressly set forth herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other materials that you may access on or through the App. We reserve all rights in and to the Salina Materials not expressly granted to you in the Terms. For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (i) that your “purchase” of a KittyHat, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Salina Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with that KittyHat) other than those expressly contained in these Terms; and (ii) that you do not have the right to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Salina Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with that KittyHat) in any way without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion.
                
                B. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.
                
                C. You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you may not, and may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content; (ii) distribute viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature; (iii) impersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise); (iv) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the App any content that infringes the intellectual proprietary rights of any party; (v) use the App to violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others; (vi) engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity; (vii) interfere with other users’ enjoyment of the App; (viii) exploit the App for any unauthorized commercial purpose; (ix) modify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the App; (x) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the App or any part of it; (xi) reformat or frame any portion of the App; (xii) display any content on the App that contains any hate-related or violent content or contains any other material, products or services that violate or encourage conduct that would violate any criminal laws, any other applicable laws, or any third party rights; (xiii) use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the App or the content posted on the App, or to collect information about its users for any unauthorized purpose; (xiv) create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses; or (xv) access or use the App for the purpose of creating a product or service that is competitive with any of our products or services.
                
                5. Termination
                
                You may terminate these Terms at any time by discontinuing your access to and use of the App. You will not receive any refunds if you terminate these Terms. You agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the App. You agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination. If we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity. Upon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party. Sections 2.C and 3 through 14 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.
                
                6. Disclaimer of Warranties
                
                YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND ANY PART OF IT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SITE, ANY SMART CONTRACT, OR ANY EXTERNAL WEBSITES), 
                
                INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
                
                FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY.

                7. Limitation of Liability
                
                A.

                C. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
                
                8. Indemnification
                
                You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Salina Labs and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys’ fees arising out of or in any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, or (ii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App.

                The App may include interactions with other sites including hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), and access to the App from within other sites.  All of these interactions are provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.
                
                10. Changes to the Terms
                
                We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make changes, we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.
                
                11. Changes to the App
                
                We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience.

                12. Children
                
                You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF.

                Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                
                14. General
                
                These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Salina Labs, govern your access to and use of the App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties related to your access to or use of the App, whether oral or written. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger. Should any part of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the courts located in Delaware, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there. We will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations that result from any condition beyond our reasonable control, including, but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood, acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, Internet disturbances, Ethereum network failures, or acts or omissions of third parties. You agree that we may provide you with notices (including, without limitation those regarding changes to these Terms) by email, regular mail, or postings on the App. By contacting us via email or by otherwise providing us with your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.
